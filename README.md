## IST 256 Final Project
**Description:**
For my project, I created a joke company to sell bootlegs dvds online. This comes partially as a response
to increasing costs  and decreasing quality of streaming services. It would be nice to have a legal alternative
to streaming, because this is definitely not legal. 


# Feedback

## Usability Session 1

**Passenger Notes:** My project at the time of the rough draft was severely lacking in content. I had not 
settled on a theme yet, but items were in the store and some of the functionality was there.

**Driver Notes:** Consider having shopping cart scroll with page.

**Takeaways:** Pick a theme and get to work. Just pick the first thing that comes to mind.


## Usability Session 2

**Passenger Notes:** The shadow effect I had on the store items was well-liked by both testers.

**Driver Notes:** We talked about the process for getting the shopping cart to work and how the information would
stored. 

**Takeaways:** I realized I could keep the item information in one array, then create a 2nd array of references to the first
to call that information and show it in the cart.
